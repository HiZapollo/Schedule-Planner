# Work Schedule Planner

## Description

This website was made as a project in a coding bootcamp to teach me how to build a webpage using third party APIs. This project was built from a starter code provided by the bootcamp, where the javascript was empty. This project is a schedule planner for times between 9AM and 5PM, the typical work schedule. You can see the current date at the top of the page, and the time slots will change color depending on if the time slot is in the past, present or future. You can type events into each time slot, and then click the save button in order to store it in local storage. When the page is reloaded, it will still have the events that were saved.

## Usage

This website can be used to schedule events from times 9AM to 5PM. Just type whatever plan you have in the appropriate time slot, then click the save button. When the time slot is in the future, it will be green. It will be red in the present hour, and grey if in the past.
